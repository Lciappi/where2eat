# Where2Eat

Deciding where to eat is hard. Nowadays, a simple google search yields hundreds of options, making deciding what to try next an overwhelming task, even more so when you’re in a group. Enter Where2Eat. 

Our app allows users to enter a flexible text prompt describing what they’re craving. For example, one could enter “very cheap sushi” or “fun happy hour” alongside their location and the time to meet. Our app uses the Google Maps API to find the best results based on the user’s location and preferences. We extract the top places nearby and create an online room that other users can join where they can see a summary containing the results with ratings, walking/driving duration, and distance from the address for each restaurant. Users can vote for their top choices and view the most voted option. Say goodbye to all the countless hours spent arguing with your coworkers or friends about where to go next!
